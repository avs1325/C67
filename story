    once upon a time in a forest there lived a monkey who resided on a berry tree which
was on the banks of a river. In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife...
One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested under the berry tree.
The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. the crocodile came back the next day 
for more fruits as he loved them. As days past by, the crocodile and the monkey became 
good friends

one day the monkey sent some fruitsfor the crocodiles wife. she ate the fruits and 
liked them but was jealous as she did not like her husband spending time with the 
monkey. she told her husband, "if the fruits are so juicy, i wonder how sweet would the
heart of the monkey be. get me the heart of the monkey". the crocodile was not willing 
to kill his friend but had no choice.
